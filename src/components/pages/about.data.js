		`
		I develop software applications from all sides of the stack. 
		My goals are to create engaging and efficient user interfaces by developing ergonomic codebases with fellow developers.

		As of right now, I spend a lot of time studying and building applications using [ JavaScript, Sass, SVG, Angular, ...<insert plethora of JavaScript libraries here> ].
		I am very adept at within the browser environment and know my way around common backend services and linux based servers.
		However these tools and languages are just means to an end of practicing Information Architecture and creating fluid User Experiences.
		
		I am language agnostic, and have no problem picking up the tools required for a task.
		Its healthy to learn new languages, both programming and natural, so I do my best at branching out so I can integrate new insights.
		
		In the near future I intend to pick up where I left off with Machine Learning techniques by getting into analytics, visualization, and either machine vision or linguistics.
		I have taken classes on and am very comfortable with the ideas of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and prefer to be in environments or projects where these are used.
		
		Life is one big state machine, so I practice maths, software engineering, cognitive science, art, and kickboxing in my spare time to get to the future I want to be in.
		I believe personal improvement is achieved through discipline, virtue, and occasional skepticism.

		If I sound like someone you would like to contact, please feel free to reach out to me through email or phone.

	text: (`
		This is my first site ever fully created by me. 
		While it is just a resume and about page, I intend on creating a demos and blog sections.
		I am more concerned with design and style of this site, as I am going to use to demostrate the ideas I have concerning UI and UX. 
		I intend on using this as the testing ground for a few app ideas I have.
		
		This being said, there is much work that can be done to make this site way more efficient, especially on mobile. 
		However this is on the road map and will be documented on here in the future, most likely forming the grassroots of my blog.
		
		I prefer a modularized and component based approach to user interfaces and reusing tools/techniques as much as possible.
		This site was made using Angular, jQuery, GSAP for some path morphing, and the greatest tool ever, Lodash/Underscore. 

		Thanks for visiting!
